            Education, in essence, should bring to the fore the inner and inherent potential of the student. Educational
            institute, therefore, has to distinguish itself by providing sound infrastructure for higher education to
            leverage knowledge and innovation. More so, since the society and the nation look up to these centres for
            fulfilment of their aspirations and expectations.Education, be it primary or higher,need to go beyond its
            scope of merely imparting information and skill.It is precisely here that educational institutes have to play
            a pivotal role. It is rightly said that the child is not vessel to be filled but a lamp to be lit. Besides proactively
             providing an environment conducive to foster and nurture the inherent potential of the students, the institute need
              to consciously promote an inquisitive spirit among the students. The students would then be able to get acquainted
               with latest and upcoming research and inventions in science and technology.</div>  <div class="contain" data-aos="fade-down-left" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="linear" style="text-indent: 15vw;"> Hence, the institute has the onus of
                providing a platform for overall development of ethical, moral and human aspects of the personality of the students.
                The teachers are to be epitome of all that is good and need to maintain a professional demeanour by embracing traits
                like honesty, integrity and sincerity. This would go long way in bringing aboutquantitative and qualitative expansion
                of the student personality. Let us, therefore, pledge ourselves to rebuilding our institution and thus live up to the
                expectations and the trust reposed in us. Let us make concerted and sincere efforts to restore the glory and eminence
                to this institute. Together we march ahead to achieve the excellence.
